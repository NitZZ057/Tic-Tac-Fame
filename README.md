# Tic-Tac-Fame
Tic-tac-toe (also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

  This is a fun project created using Java Swing.
I've customized this game so that it replaces Xs and Os with first letter of players name. Hence, I named it as 'Tic-Tac-Fame'.

It gives the experience of bieng more pesonalized with the game.

If three tiles are successfully marked in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row by a player then the player wins 
and the corresponding tiles are highlighted in green.
